3rd coursework for KCL's 1st year CS programming module (PPA). Grade: First (93%)
This was a pair coursework and I did it with Tom (who I'll link his GitHub whenever I get it). 
He did a lot on the GUI and the buttons, and I worked a lot on making the code nice, fixing some bugs and on the report. 
Both of us worked a lot on the logic.
